Bonjour para toutes mon amis! 

That's right, I don't know french.

I can fix it!

There are 4 main components in any language:
- Active:
  - Speaking.
  - Writing.
- Passive:
  - Listening.
  - Reading.

If I'm able to listen and read french to some extent, I'll learn to speak and write quicker.
Besides this, I wish to understand more than to be understood.

So...

Let's automatically generate Anki card decks that contain the pronunciation of the most 
common words said by actual natives, including their IPA format!

J-désirée à avoir succès!
